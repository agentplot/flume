# A Cargo.lock's git packages against git-crates.nix (the flake spec; the
# change flume-publishes-its-own-flake-and-module, design 2, as Boomdrive's
# nix/tests/git-crates.nix): each git package has an entry, each entry is a
# git package, and each entry's revision is the one Cargo.lock names. Each
# failure names the package, and a moved revision both revisions.
