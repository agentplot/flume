# settling Specification

## Purpose
What moves a place on with no process of flume's own: a settle run when
its agent goes quiet, when the merge queue decides and when the
terminal watches, or before every acting command where nothing watches;
and a landing kind's submission, waited on and sent back when it fails
(I7, I8; 40, 46, 111 to 113, 119 to 122, 124).

## Requirements

### Requirement: A settle takes every step the place allows

A settle of a place SHALL read every fact of it again and take each
step Part A then allows: collect the outcomes of its submission, read
its current stage's end, end a delivered stage's quiet agent and start
its next stage unless that stage waits on its caller, submit a landing
kind's place whose last stage delivered, and tidy a place whose work is
over; and then start the stages waiting for room on the host, as many
as there is room for. A settle SHALL be safe to repeat (40, 46, 70,
74).

#### Scenario: A commit and a quiet agent

- **WHEN** a code stage's fake agent commits, goes quiet, and the agent seam's on-quiet settles the place
- **THEN** the agent is ended and the next stage started in that settle, before any watch runs (S29, 121)

#### Scenario: A held next stage

- **WHEN** a construct delivers and the launch holds every later stage and the submission
- **THEN** the settle ends the agent and starts nothing more (S7, 47)

#### Scenario: Room freed by a settle

- **WHEN** a settle ends one place's agent on a full host while another place waits for room
- **THEN** the same settle starts the waiting place's stage (46, 70)

### Requirement: Attended and watched

Where the terminal seam keeps a watch, its watch SHALL settle each
place on its stated bound. Where it keeps none, every command of
flume's that acts on places SHALL settle every place on the host before
it acts, and status and a prompt's rendering SHALL settle nothing (119,
122).

#### Scenario: Killed with nobody watching

- **WHEN** under a fake terminal with no watch a code stage's agent stops with nothing delivered, and later a caller drops another place
- **THEN** nothing reads the stage until the drop, which settles every place first, and status then reports the stage lost (S27)

#### Scenario: Crashed under a watch

- **WHEN** under a fake terminal with a watch a code stage's agent stops with nothing delivered and its on-quiet never runs
- **THEN** the watch's settle reads the stage lost within its bound, with no caller asking, and starts no agent (S28)

### Requirement: A landing kind's place is submitted at its head

Once a landing kind's last stage has delivered and its agent has ended,
a settle SHALL submit the place's own branch at its head to its base
through the merge queue seam, holding no wait on the verdict, unless the
launch holds the submission or the place's work is over. A landed place
SHALL be tidied by flume, the merge queue removing nothing of it. A kind
that does not land SHALL never reach the merge queue (66, 111, 113).

#### Scenario: A fix lands and the merge queue removes it

- **WHEN** a fix's code stage delivers, its agent goes quiet, the place is submitted, and the fake merge queue lands it
- **THEN** the merge queue removes nothing; the next settle collects the landing, and flume removes the place through the place seam and its branch when it holds nothing its base lacks, and keeps no held state of it (S1, 66, 67, 113)

#### Scenario: A landing before flume submits

- **WHEN** a held submission's place is landed by a hand's submission of its own branch
- **THEN** the core reads the work over, never makes the held submission, and tidies the place (S30, 63)

#### Scenario: Another place's landing

- **WHEN** a place's work reaches its base inside another place's landing
- **THEN** the place stays and its next stage waits on its caller (S8, 63)

### Requirement: A failed submission sends the place back

A failed or conflicting submission SHALL send the place back to the
stage its kind's last stage names, that last stage where it names none,
started with a fresh agent and the merge queue's words as its words, the
stages after it run again and the place submitted again, while the
place's goings-back, by submission and by finding together, are fewer
than the kind allows, after which the place SHALL wait for its caller
(112, 131).

#### Scenario: A failure, then a landing

- **WHEN** the fake merge queue fails a change's submission with its words, then lands the second
- **THEN** code starts with a fresh agent and those words, code and verify deliver again, the place is submitted again, it lands, and its work is over (S19, S35)

#### Scenario: The count reached

- **WHEN** a kind allows one send-back and the fake merge queue fails both submissions
- **THEN** after the second failure the place waits for its caller's retry or drop and starts nothing (112)

### Requirement: A withdrawn or refused submission leaves the place waiting

A withdrawn submission SHALL leave the place waiting for its caller, and
a submission refused at submit likewise, status naming why (112).

#### Scenario: A withdrawn submission

- **WHEN** the fake merge queue gives a place's submission withdrawn
- **THEN** the place waits for its caller, starts nothing, and status names the withdrawal (112)

### Requirement: A submission's outcome is collected at the settles that follow

Every settle of a place flume submitted SHALL collect the outcomes
pending for it through the merge queue seam's inbox and act on each
once, and where its submission is open SHALL drive its base one round
through step, once per repository and base in one command; a settle
SHALL never submit the place anew for an open submission (111, 124,
125, 133).

#### Scenario: A restart while under test

- **WHEN** the core is rebuilt over the same fakes while a change's submission is under test, and the fake merge queue lands it before the next settle
- **THEN** that settle collects the landing, never submits anew, and tidies the place (S34)

#### Scenario: Two places on one base

- **WHEN** one settle of every place finds two places' submissions open on one base
- **THEN** the fake merge queue's log holds one step for that base
