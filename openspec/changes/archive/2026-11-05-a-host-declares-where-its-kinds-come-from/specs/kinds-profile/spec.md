## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Packages, identities and locks through weir's crate

The kinds profile SHALL read a kind as a launch writes it, a package with
its content hash, a source's listing, the repository's lock at a revision
and a lock on disk, and SHALL write a lock, each through `weir-kinds` at
its pinned revision alone; it SHALL spell every identity it answers as
weir's crate spells it, and flume's own code SHALL parse, spell or hash
none (core.4; weir 88 to 93, C.4).

#### Scenario: A package's hash wherever it lies

- **WHEN** one package is copied to two scratch directories, one under a link, and each is read at its identity
- **THEN** both read the same kind and the same hash, and the hash changes when one prompt's byte does (156; weir 90)

#### Scenario: A source's listing

- **WHEN** a scratch `kinds_dir` holds `review@1/` and `review@2/`, each with a `kind.toml`, and `notes/`, `lint@x/` and `lint@1/` with no `kind.toml`
- **THEN** the listing answers acme/review@1 and acme/review@2 alone (159)

#### Scenario: The repository's lock at a revision

- **WHEN** a scratch repository commits `.config/flume.lock` recording `flume/change@1`, then a second revision recording nothing
- **THEN** the lock at the first revision records flume/change@1 with its hash, the one at the second records nothing, and one at a revision with no lock is answered as none (20, 155)

#### Scenario: A lock written and read back

- **WHEN** the profile writes a lock of acme/review@1 and acme/review@2 to a scratch file and reads it
- **THEN** it reads both entries as written, and a write that fails leaves the file as it was (155; weir 91)

#### Scenario: Flume's own as packages

- **WHEN** flume's own kinds are read
- **THEN** each is a package with its identity, `flume/fix@1`, `flume/chore@1`, `flume/change@1` and `flume/change@2`, and its hash (156, 157)
